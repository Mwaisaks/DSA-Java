**Tree Data Structure** is a hierachical structure that is used to represent data in form parent child relationship

**Binary Tree**
It's a non-linear and hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children referred to as the **left child** and **right child**
Root - topmost node, leaves - bottom-most node.

**Terminologies in a Binary Tree**
    Nodes: The fundamental part of a binary tree, where each node contains data and link to two child nodes.
    Root: The topmost node in a tree is known as the root node. It has no parent and serves as the starting point for all nodes in the tree.
    Parent Node: A node that has one or more child nodes. In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children.
    Child Node: A node that is a descendant of another node (its parent).
    Leaf Node: A node that does not have any children or both children are null.
    Internal Node: A node that has at least one child. This includes all nodes except the leaf nodes.
    Depth of a Node: The number of edges from a specific node to the root node. The depth of the root node is zero.
    Height of a Binary Tree: The number of nodes from the deepest leaf node to the root node.

**Properties of binary Tree**
    The maximum number of nodes at level L of a binary tree is 2L
    The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height H is 2H â€“ 1
    Total number of leaf nodes in a binary tree = total number of nodes with 2 children + 1
    In a Binary Tree with N nodes, the minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1)
    A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L |+ 1 levels


**Types of Binary Trees**
1. **On basis of Number of Children**
   * Full Binary Tree
   * Degenerated Binary Tree
   * Skewed Binary Trees
2. **On basis of Completion of Levels**
   * Full Binary Tree
   * Perfect Binary Tree
   * Balanced Binary Tree
3. **On basis of Node Values**
   * Binary Search Tree
   * AVL Tree
   * Red Black Tree
   * B Tree
   * B+ Tree
   * Segment Tree

**Operations on a Binary Tree**
1. **Traversal**

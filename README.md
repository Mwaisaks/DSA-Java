Algorithms
A set of step by step instructions that are required to solve a given problem or achieve a desired goal.

4. Insert 
5. Delete
6. Traverse

**Characteristics of an Algorithm**
* Unambiguous - clear and concise
* Input - 0 or more
* Output - 1 or more 
* Feasible - with the available resources
* Independent - of the P.L
* Finite - complete after a finite number of steps

Algorithms are written in Pseudocode and Flowcharts

**Algorithm Analysis**
- Evaluating the performance of algorithms and programs. Efficiency is measured in terms of time and space.
In 2 stages:
1. Priori Analysis
Theoretical Analysis. 
Determined while assuming other factors e.g. processor speed are constant and have no effect on implementation.

2. Posterior Analysis.
Empirical Analysis
The algorithm is implemented using a P.L and then executed on a target machine, actual stats are collected; time and space

**Logic Building**

- Creating clear, step-by-step methods to solve problems using simple rules and principles

**Tips**
Understand the Problem statement.
Generate examples: Create additional input and output cases for each problem.
Draw observations and patterns based on the examples you created
Start with basic ways to solve the problem and apply further conditions.

**Expression Parsing**
**Notation** can be defined as a way of writing mathematical expression.
3 types based on how the operator is used;
* Infix notation
* Prefix (Polish) notation
* Postfix (Reverse-Polish) notation

**Infix notation** 
Operators are used in between operands ie a + b
not suitable for computers; could be difficult and costly in terms of time and space consumption.

**Prefix notation also Polish notation**
Operator is written ahed of operands +ab

**Postfix notation also Reversed Polish Notation**
ab+

**Parsing Expression**
for efficiency infix notations are converted to prefix or postfix and then computed. 
To parse an arithmetic expression we look into operator precedence and associativity.

**Precedence**
Which operator goes first.

**Associativity**
Associativity describes the rule where operators with the same precedence appear in an
expression.

**Searching Algorithms**
2 most common algorithms
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

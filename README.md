**Characteristics of an Algorithm**
Unambiguous - clear and concise
Input - 0 or more
Output - 1 or more 
Feasible - with the available resources
Independent - of the P.L
Finite - complete after a finite number of steps

Algorithms are written in Pseudocode and Flowcharts

**Algorithm Analysis**
- Evaluating the performance of algorithms and programs. Efficiency is measured in terms of time and space.
In 2 stages:
1. Priori Analysis
Theoretical Analysis. 
Determined while assuming other factors e.g. processor speed are constant and have no effect on implementation.

2. Posterior Analysis.
Empirical Analysis
The algorithm is implemented using a P.L and then executed on a target machine, actual stats are collected; time and space

**Logic Building**

- Creating clear, step-by-step methods to solve problems using simple rules and principles

**Tips**
Understand the Problem statement.
Generate examples: Create additional input and output cases for each problem.
Draw observations and patterns based on the examples you created
Start with basic ways to solve the problem and apply further conditions.
